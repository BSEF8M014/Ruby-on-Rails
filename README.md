<h2 >Prerequisites</h2>
<p >Learning the framework will be much easier if you have some familiarity beforehand rather than trying to make adjustments on the fly. It would be helpful if you were familiar with the following:</p>
<ol >
<li>
<p>The <strong>Ruby</strong> programming language: You do not need to be an expert at <strong>Ruby</strong>, but an understanding of its basics is essential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Since Ruby is a purely Object-Oriented Language, a basic understanding of OOP concepts would be helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic knowledge of relational databases and SQL</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p >Although you can learn Rails without necessarily knowing any of these prerequisites in advance, learning the framework will be much easier if you have some familiarity beforehand rather than trying to make adjustments on the fly.</p>

<h1> Introduction to Rails </h1>
<p>
One of the great things about Rails is that anyone can learn it, even with minimal prior programming experience. Rails is a full-stack framework with many useful tools seamlessly integrated that will allow you to rapidly create dynamic, full-fledged applications. Its structure and conventions take very little time to learn, saving you a lot of time and effort in the long run.

Here are some of the features that make Rails such a powerful framework:
<ol>
<li><b>Automated Testing:</b> Rails provides built-in testing to make test cases easier to write and execute.</li>

<li><b>Scaffolding:</b> This feature allows us to easily create models to manage our data, views to enable user-data interaction, and controllers to manage model-view communication. Scaffolding auto-generates a set of MVC files. In later sections, we will look at application structures set up with and without scaffolding.</li>

<li><b>Active Record:</b> This framework operates on the assumption that ensuring data access logic as part of the object will educate users of that object on how to read and write to the database. Thus, objects carry both persistent data as well as behavior that operates on that data.</li>

<li><b>The Rails Community:</b> Rails has a very active and enthusiastic community, so you can find tools and support for whatever issue you may be facing. It is also actively under development, so there are regular fixes and updates.</li>
  </ol>
