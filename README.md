<h2 >Prerequisites</h2>

<ol >
<li>
<p>The <strong>Ruby</strong> programming language: You do not need to be an expert at <strong>Ruby</strong>, but an understanding of its basics is essential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Since Ruby is a purely Object-Oriented Language, a basic understanding of OOP concepts would be helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic knowledge of relational databases and SQL</p>
</li>
</ol>
