Who is this course for?#
This course is aimed at beginners who wish to learn the Ruby on Rails (Rails) web development framework, and developers who already have some experience with web development and are looking to learn the Rails framework.

Prerequisites#
Learning the framework will be much easier if you have some familiarity beforehand rather than trying to make adjustments on the fly. It would be helpful if you were familiar with the following:

The Ruby programming language: You do not need to be an expert at Ruby, but an understanding of its basics is essential

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Since Ruby is a purely Object-Oriented Language, a basic understanding of OOP concepts would be helpful.

Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS

Basic knowledge of relational databases and SQL

Although you can learn Rails without necessarily knowing any of these prerequisites in advance, learning the framework will be much easier if you have some familiarity beforehand rather than trying to make adjustments on the fly.
